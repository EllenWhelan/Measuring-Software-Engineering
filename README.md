# Measuring-Software-Engineering

The Meausring software engineering paper is in PDF format entitled 'Measuring Software Engineering'.

The GitInterrogation folder contains the GitHub Access assignment. This was done as a python project using the github3.py libraty (https://github3.readthedocs.io/). I used this project mostly to get used to interrogating an API using a library.
