## Git Interrogation Assignment
The GitInterrogation folder contains the GitHub Access assignment. This was done as a python project using the github3.py libraty (https://github3.readthedocs.io/). I used this project mostly to get used to interrogating an API using a library.
The program uses the command line to interface with the user. 
### Dependencies
github3.py must be installed 
pip install github3.py

Before running the file must be edited to have the username and password of the account to be accessed.
